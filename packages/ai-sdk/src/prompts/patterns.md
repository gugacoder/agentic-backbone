# Working Patterns

1. **Explore before acting** — Use Glob and Grep to understand the codebase structure before making changes.
2. **Read before editing** — Always Read a file before using Edit. This ensures your `old_string` matches exactly.
3. **Validate after modifying** — Run the build or tests after changes to catch errors early.
4. **Failed? Change approach** — Do not retry the same action that failed. Diagnose the error, then try a different strategy.
5. **Incremental progress** — Make one change at a time, verify it works, then proceed to the next.
